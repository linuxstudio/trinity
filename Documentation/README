AsciiDoc documentation for project Trinity with versioning using Git

To compile the document you need to install asciidoc http://asciidoc.org/ 
from the website or via your linux distribution's package manager.
If you want to compile only the html type:

make

If you want to compile pdf type (you may need to install other
packages like dblatex, but these are usually installed as dependencies
if you use the distribution's packaged version):

make pdf

Other formats (e.g. epub and odt) will be added in the future.
