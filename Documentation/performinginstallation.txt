Performing the installation
---------------------------
To start installing a new controller node, select free switch ports on
the HP switch. The port used will determine the hostname of the new
controller node (as seen from the master). If you plug into port 3,
your controller will be called controller03. You will also need to
plugin the BMC network. We use blue cables for the PXE network and
black cables for the management network. 

In many cases, the switch port will have been used before, so you need
to “undiscover” the old node definition from the xCAT configuration.
This is most easily done by removing the whole of the node definition
from the xCAT database.

----
[root@controller ~]# rmnodecfg controllerNN 
----

[TIP]
This command will complain that it was unable to remove a file
`/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/<HEX>`. This error is caused by the fact that we
use XNBA instead of default PXE. You can safely ignore the error
message.

After that you need to add the node to the xCAT configuration. 

----
nodeadd controllerNN groups=controllers
----

Now plug your node’s BMC port and PXE bootable port into the HP switch
and turn it on. This will start discovery of the node. To check the
status of the node discovery tail /var/log/messages. After some time
you should see DHCP requests from the controller logged. The complete
sequence should look something like this:
